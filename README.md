<h1 align="left" id="title">NoSleep - Reset your Mac sleep timer</h1>

<p id="description">An app for bypassing the Mac OS sleep/display-off cycles.</p>

 <h2> Introduction </h2>
<p>This project is created with an intent to solve a very annoying problem, "The Mac Sleep Timer". This utility app comes in handy especially when the device is owned by organisations and they don't allow you to modify Mac display settings.</p>
<p>There are few solutions present in the market but they don't seem to work the exactly I want or have some dodgy permission requests form the user. So I created an open-source solution which can be used by anyone free of charge and contribute to it.</p>

<h2>Installation Steps</h2>

<p>1. Checkout Releases section at the right</p>

<p>2. Download the app "NoSleep.app.zip" from the latest release </p>

<p>3. Unzip the file and start using the app</p>

<p>4. The app instructions are pretty intuitive and easy to follow </p>

#### Important: Please make sure the app is running in the background for it to work as intended. </p>
